# Simple Calculator in C++

Welcome to the Simple Calculator project! This project demonstrates a basic calculator application built using C++. It's perfect for beginners looking to enhance their programming skills and understand fundamental arithmetic operations.

## Features

- **Addition (+)**: Add two numbers.
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication (*)**: Multiply two numbers.
- **Division (/)**: Divide one number by another (includes error handling for division by zero).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP file):
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SimpleCalculator.git
   cd SimpleCalculator
   ```

2. **Compile the code**:
   ```sh
   g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```sh
   ./calculator
   ```

### Usage

Upon running the application, you will see a menu prompting you to select an operation:
